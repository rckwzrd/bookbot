# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Simple python script for counting words and characters in text using standard library tools.

Some things this script is missing:

- tests
- linting
- doc strings
- error handling
- flexible path args
- feature for adding books

Does that make it a bad project? No, not if you are just trying to get reps in.
